# Window Management on the Web

This repository considers web platform functionality to allow scripts to query
the device for information about its screens, and place content on specific
screens. The goals here are to explore background, use cases, and proposals for
extending window placement capabilities of web applications on multi-screen
devices.

See the [Editorâ€™s Draft](https://w3c.github.io/window-management/) of the proposed specification.
The [Explainer](https://github.com/w3c/window-management/blob/main/EXPLAINER.md),
[Additional Explorations](https://github.com/w3c/window-management/blob/main/additional_explorations.md),
and [Security and Privacy](https://github.com/w3c/window-management/blob/main/security_and_privacy.md)
documents also have historical context and some deeper dives into these topics.
File [new issues](https://github.com/w3c/window-management/issues/new/choose), reply to our
[Discourse posting](https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-supporting-window-placement-on-multi-screen-devices/3948),
or reach out as you see fit with feedback, relevant use cases, and thoughts.

The specification is being developed by the
[W3C Second Screen Working Group](http://www.w3.org/2014/secondscreen/). Please
refer to the group's [Work Mode](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Second_Screen/Work_Mode)
for instructions on how to contribute.
